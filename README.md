## Setting up connection to Webtor RestAPI

You have to set up connection to [Webtor RestAPI](https://github.com/webtor-io/rest-api) before using WebUI.

If you have already installed [backend part](https://github.com/webtor-io/helm-charts),
then you have to proxy rest-api from your k8s instance to your local machine with [kubefwd](https://github.com/txn2/kubefwd):
```
sudo kubefwd svc -f metadata.name=rest-api -n webtor
```
or with [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl):
```shell
kubectl port-forward svc/rest-api 9090:80 -n webtor

# you have to setup additional environment variables before starting application
export REST_API_SERVICE_PORT=9090
export REST_API_SERVICE_HOST=localhost
```

If you have [RapidAPI subscription](https://rapidapi.com/paveltatarsky-Dx4aX7s_XBt/api/webtor/)
you can just do the following:

```shell
export RAPIDAPI_KEY={YOUR_RAPIDAPI_KEY}
export RAPIDAPI_HOST={YOUR_RAPIDAPI_HOST}
```
